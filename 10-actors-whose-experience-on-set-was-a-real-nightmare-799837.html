<time>17 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, the more real-looking the outfit&nbsp;is, the more difficult it&nbsp;is&nbsp;for actors to&nbsp;wear it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the set. The history of&nbsp;cinematography is&nbsp;filled with many cases of&nbsp;when the wardrobe turned into a&nbsp;real instrument of&nbsp;torture.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> were astonished by&nbsp;the stories that are hidden behind some of&nbsp;the cult outfits from movies and we&nbsp;sincerely believe that each of&nbsp;the characters of&nbsp;our article deserves an&nbsp;individual Oscar statuette for their stamina and endurance. At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article, we&nbsp;are going to&nbsp;tell you why the actors who embodied Batman onscreen hate his cult garment.</p><p><h2>Rebecca Romijn&nbsp;— X-Men</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/081/50c/71fd8451e0a851a128641d0558.jpg><p>In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;transform into the blue-skinned mutant Mystique, this actress had to&nbsp;<a href=#>sit for</a> 12&nbsp;exhausting hours of&nbsp;<a href=# title=makeup data-link=tag>makeup</a> during the shoot of&nbsp;the first part of&nbsp;this franchise. Later the crew managed to&nbsp;whittle this time down to&nbsp;7&nbsp;hours. But still, Rebecca had to&nbsp;spend most of&nbsp;her time in&nbsp;the makeup artist’s chair. The actress would <a href=#>go</a>&nbsp;for makeup procedures at&nbsp;midnight so&nbsp;that she could be&nbsp;ready on&nbsp;the set by&nbsp;9&nbsp;AM together with other actors. At&nbsp;first, scales were <a href=#>glued</a> to&nbsp;her body, then her skin was covered with blue paint. The most annoying thing about the costume was that it&nbsp;left blue marks everywhere. Later Romijn would joke that her colleagues could easily understand when she used the lavatory thanks to&nbsp;the colorful trace she left on&nbsp;the toilet seat.</p><p><h2>Jeff Bridges&nbsp;— Tron</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9e2/b13/fe2a575e09a2d8f4a3b5e567d7.jpg><p>The costume designers had one big task&nbsp;— to&nbsp;deprive Bridges’ character, the “digitized” Flynn, of&nbsp;any <a href=#>anatomic characteristics</a>. For that, the actor was dressed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special bandage, which was covered with tight overalls. The bottom part of&nbsp;the costume was so&nbsp;tight to&nbsp;the body, that the actor once jokingly <a href=#>said</a> that there were still scars from the bandages on&nbsp;his skin.</p><p><h2>Doug Jones&nbsp;— The Shape of&nbsp;Water</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/061/239/8b8ddf56f9b93f7597fe0dc788.jpg><p>The collection of&nbsp;Doug Jones’ roles is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;various monsters. That’s why it&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;quite difficult to&nbsp;surprise him with makeup. But still, Doug is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;remember his work on&nbsp;the movie <a href=#>The Shape of&nbsp;Water</a> for a&nbsp;long time. The actor’s shooting day would start 3&nbsp;hours earlier than his colleagues’ - because that is&nbsp;how much time was spent on&nbsp;makeup. At&nbsp;first, 4&nbsp;assistants would pull the latex suit over Jones’ body, then they’d put on&nbsp;the gloves with membranes on&nbsp;him, and finally, fiberglass neck pads and a&nbsp;helmet, in&nbsp;which a&nbsp;special gill control mechanism was built, were attached to&nbsp;him. The actor confessed that he&nbsp;felt totally helpless because he&nbsp;couldn’t even open a&nbsp;door by&nbsp;himself and he&nbsp;also could not breathe through his mouth.</p><p><h2>Emma Stone&nbsp;— The Favourite</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b3d/9cb/95d7185a6f8b80e1af8a56a986.jpg><p>The action of&nbsp;the movie takes place in&nbsp;England in&nbsp;the 18th century, when ladies still wore tight corsets for the sake of&nbsp;fashion. The movie actresses all experienced what it&nbsp;was like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;squeezed into a&nbsp;“whale shell.” <a href=#>Emma Stone</a> confessed that she couldn’t breathe normally during the first month of&nbsp;shooting and that smelling menthol would help her greatly during that period. But that was not the only trouble she faced: after a&nbsp;while the actress’s inner organs shifted. Luckily, Emma was soon able to&nbsp;overcome these issues, but she will definitely not forget that experience for a&nbsp;long time.</p><p><h2>Oscar Isaac&nbsp;— X-Men: Apocalypse</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f6a/067/420db35045bb6114c500b73c96.png><p>The <a href=#>costume</a> of&nbsp;the X-Men: Apocalypse movie’s main villain weighed 40&nbsp;pounds, while the process of&nbsp;getting made&nbsp;up, which consisted of&nbsp;applying numerous layers of&nbsp;glue and latex, took several hours. Before the start of&nbsp;the project, Isaac was excited about the opportunity to&nbsp;work with many talented actors. And he&nbsp;was extremely disappointed when he&nbsp;eventually had to&nbsp;spend the most of&nbsp;the shooting in&nbsp;loneliness. In&nbsp;between takes, he&nbsp;was put on&nbsp;a&nbsp;specially designed saddle and rolled into a&nbsp;cool tent to&nbsp;get some relief. This happened every day. The process of&nbsp;removing the makeup was just as&nbsp;inconvenient: it&nbsp;was torn off his skin in&nbsp;pieces, which sounds like torture, doesn’t it?</p><p><h2>Michelle Pfeiffer&nbsp;— Batman Returns</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/5ec/8e2/050cb1516ea981ec11f1ad555f.jpeg><p>It&nbsp;has been almost 30&nbsp;years since the shooting of&nbsp;Batman Returns, but the actress still recalls this nightmare experience. In&nbsp;1992, technologies were not as&nbsp;developed as&nbsp;they are today and in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get dressed in&nbsp;the latex costume, Michelle had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through real <a href=#>torture</a>. At&nbsp;first, she was sprinkled with talc from head to&nbsp;toe. After she finally managed to&nbsp;fit into the garment, they would suck out the extra air from inside with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;vacuum device. Finally, the latex was covered with a&nbsp;silicone-based gel to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;more gloss. The multi-hour wearing of&nbsp;the suit also turned an&nbsp;ordinary visit to&nbsp;the bathroom into a&nbsp;real adventure.</p><p><h2>Anthony Daniels&nbsp;— Star Wars: A&nbsp;New Hope (Episode&nbsp;IV)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc3/382/fe461754ffafcb1c24add75037.jpg><p>It&nbsp;took about <a href=#>2&nbsp;hours</a> to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;the 60-pound <a href=#>costume</a>. Moreover, part of&nbsp;the shooting took place in&nbsp;Tunisia, which has an&nbsp;extremely hot climate. On&nbsp;the very first workday, part of&nbsp;the costume’s left leg <a href=#>shattered</a> and cut the actor’s leg. But perhaps the most terrible thing was the <a href=#>indifference</a> from the crew: many people would simply forget that there was a&nbsp;real human behind that armor.</p><p><h2>Peter Mayhew&nbsp;— Star Wars</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/231/c61/36a2d05296bd1b8270743560e8.jpg><p>Peter Mayhew’s suffering can be&nbsp;best understood and empathized with by&nbsp;dog owners. The thing&nbsp;is, Chewbacca’s <a href=#>costume</a> was made of&nbsp;<a href=#>yak</a> hair (a&nbsp;cloven-hoofed bull) and mohair. And since the shooting of&nbsp;the second part of&nbsp;the saga took place in&nbsp;the snowy area, <a href=#>Chewbacca’s skin</a> would always get wet and start to&nbsp;smell bad. We&nbsp;bet that it&nbsp;was not only difficult for Peter, but for the rest of&nbsp;the crew as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>Paul Bettany&nbsp;— Avengers: Age of&nbsp;Ultron</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/512/44c/d3f28a5517a9976f71ed32d5a7.jpg><p>Originally, Paul did the <a href=#>voice over</a> for the artificial intelligence called J.A.R.V.I.S. But everything changed in&nbsp;the Avengers: Age of&nbsp;Ultron movie when the actor was asked to&nbsp;transform into Vision. Bettany had to&nbsp;spend <a href=#>3.5 hours</a> in&nbsp;the makeup artists’ chair. At&nbsp;first, his face was covered with multi-layered makeup and then the actor was dressed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tight spandex suit. The costume was also equipped with some kind of&nbsp;cooler (tubes with icy water) to&nbsp;keep the actor from overheating.</p><p><h2>Lily James&nbsp;— Cinderella</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f1/450/6e59f6588e9dbf45fe3906bee4.jpg><p>Putting on&nbsp;that magical dress, which consisted of&nbsp;12&nbsp;layers of&nbsp;silk in&nbsp;different colors, took <a href=#>45&nbsp;minutes</a> every time. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;make her waist look stunning without retouching, Lily would wear an&nbsp;extremely tight corset. It&nbsp;was so&nbsp;rough that the actress had to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;special diet while shooting the movie. Lily <a href=#>shared</a>, “When [the corset] was on&nbsp;we&nbsp;would be&nbsp;on&nbsp;continuous days so&nbsp;we&nbsp;wouldn’t stop for lunch —you’d be&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;eating on&nbsp;the move. In&nbsp;that case, I&nbsp;couldn’t untie the corset. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you ate food it&nbsp;didn’t really digest properly and I’d be&nbsp;burping all afternoon&nbsp;in [Richard Madden]’s face, and it&nbsp;was just really sort of&nbsp;unpleasant. I’d have soup so&nbsp;that&nbsp;I could still eat, but it&nbsp;wouldn’t get stuck.”</p><p><h2>Bonus: Batman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06d/b03/94c4df5e2190ea6ed11e0b0ac9.jpg><p>It&nbsp;seems that the only thing uniting all the actors who’ve played the legendary Batman is&nbsp;the hatred for this cult costume. They’ve all said that wearing the garment of&nbsp;this superhero was real torture. Val Kilmer shared that it&nbsp;took him one hour to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;the <a href=#>costume</a> and <a href=#>45&nbsp;minutes</a> to&nbsp;take it&nbsp;off. And he&nbsp;required a&nbsp;big team of&nbsp;assistants to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this. Also, the outfit didn’t have holes for ears, which caused issues with hearing. But the worst thing was that the costume lacked a&nbsp;fly and in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;use the restroom, actors had to&nbsp;use the help of&nbsp;the on-set assistants. Later <a href=#>Christian Bale</a> urged designers to&nbsp;solve this issue and make life easier for his successors.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these stories impressed you most of&nbsp;all?
