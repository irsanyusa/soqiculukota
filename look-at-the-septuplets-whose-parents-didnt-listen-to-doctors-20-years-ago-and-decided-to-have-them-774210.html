<time>06 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Doctors were sure that this wonder wouldn’t happen: there were too many risks in&nbsp;a&nbsp;multiple pregnancy. But Bobbi McCaughey had septuplets, she gave birth to&nbsp;them and raised every single one of&nbsp;them despite all the negative predictions. The first septuplets in&nbsp;the world have grown up&nbsp;<a href=#>together</a> and they turned 21&nbsp;in&nbsp;November of&nbsp;2018.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> learned more about the childhood of&nbsp;these children and the difficulties Kenny and Bobbi McCaughey had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through.</p><p>Kenny and Bobbi McCaughey. Scientists calculated that Bobbi McCaughey was more likely to&nbsp;die because of&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>asteroid</a> than to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;have septuplets.</p><p>The parents and their septuplets are a&nbsp;regular American <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. 27-year-old Kenny and 29-year-old Bobbi McCaughey were already raising a&nbsp;daughter, Mikayla, but they wanted to&nbsp;have another child, and that’s when they found out they were going to&nbsp;need some help getting pregnant. During the fertilization process, the couple was warned that there was a&nbsp;chance they could have a&nbsp;“multiple” pregnancy, and Bobbi said she was mentally ready to&nbsp;have 2&nbsp;more children. But her guesstimate was a&nbsp;little off.</p><p>Kenny remembers the day when he&nbsp;called his wife and <a href=#>asked</a> her what the ultrasound scan showed. His wife’s voice was strange and Kenny was trying to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;clear answer from her about how many. She answered, “7.” From that moment, all they could think of&nbsp;was how they were going to&nbsp;feed all these children and get them everything they needed.</p><p>Bobbi <a href=#>admits</a> that she will always remember the day when she found out about the septuplets. “It&nbsp;wasn’t like ‘Woohoo!’ There were so&nbsp;many doubts.” Doctors didn’t know what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;and they insisted on&nbsp;removing at&nbsp;least some of&nbsp;the fetuses which would give a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;the other kids to&nbsp;survive. The future mother was completely against this option and she decided she would go&nbsp;ahead and try to&nbsp;have the children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/834/bb6/201a7850d8928e021af75f413e.jpg><p>The McCaugheys at&nbsp;a&nbsp;press conference 2&nbsp;days after the birth of&nbsp;their septuplets on&nbsp;November&nbsp;21, 1997.</p><p>According to&nbsp;an&nbsp;estimate by&nbsp;experts, even when a&nbsp;woman is&nbsp;pregnant with triplets, the <a href=#>chances</a> of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;healthy child (without neurological or&nbsp;physiological problems) is&nbsp;50%. Almost half of&nbsp;all multiple pregnancies end in&nbsp;a&nbsp;miscarriage.</p><p>Doctors that specialize in&nbsp;difficult pregnancies observed the pregnancy. Right until the very late stages, they were convinced that something was about to&nbsp;go&nbsp;wrong. But nothing went wrong. The future mother felt great despite the fact that her belly alone weighed <a href=#>15&nbsp;lbs</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/adc/704/a6fa835031a49daeccfab88dba.jpg><p>The labor took place in&nbsp;a&nbsp;medical center in&nbsp;Iowa. There were <a href=#>40&nbsp;experts</a> in&nbsp;the room: perinatologists, neonatologists, breathing therapists, nurses, and anesthetists.</p><p>The children were born 9&nbsp;weeks before the due date but all of&nbsp;them survived: 4&nbsp;boys and 3&nbsp;girls. Bobbi had a&nbsp;C-section and the children remained in&nbsp;the hospital for about 2&nbsp;months.</p><p class=adme-img-description>Bobbi’s sister put her college education on&nbsp;hold to&nbsp;help the McCaughey family raise their children.</p><p>After the tired and shocked mother and her children were sent home, she had a&nbsp;huge load of&nbsp;work. Every day, the children <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>needed</a> 42&nbsp;bottles of&nbsp;food and 52&nbsp;diapers. Bobbi said that in&nbsp;the beginning, relatives helped her a&nbsp;lot. There was always someone she could rely&nbsp;on.</p><p>Not everyone supported the couple: for every 10&nbsp;good letters, there <a href=#>was</a> at&nbsp;least one where someone judged the family, and accused them of&nbsp;exploiting the children and wasting the resources of&nbsp;the world on&nbsp;just one huge family. Other people would show up&nbsp;at&nbsp;their house and ask to&nbsp;hold their children. The family continued to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;live a&nbsp;normal life in&nbsp;the spotlight of&nbsp;journalist’s attention and this really intense atmosphere.</p><p>2&nbsp;of&nbsp;the septuplets were born with cerebral palsy and during their lives, they have had several surgeries&nbsp;— now they can walk without any outside help. One of&nbsp;the siblings, <a href=#>Alexis</a>, even took part in&nbsp;a&nbsp;beauty contest for children with special needs.</p><p>During their first years, volunteers and babysitters helped the family. Over time, once the parents didn’t need to&nbsp;change hundreds of&nbsp;diapers and they had some more free time, Bobbi started working but only part-time in&nbsp;the beginning. Kenny McCaughey <a href=#>worked</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;factory that paints metal constructions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b55/175/f83a01534991ffeea389253ab2.jpg><p>Here, the children are 6&nbsp;years old: Bobbi, Alexis May, Natalie Sue, Kelsey Ann, Nathan Roy, Brandon James, and Joel Steven. The older girl is&nbsp;Mikayla.</p><p>When the children got a&nbsp;bit older, they started <a href=#>helping</a> Bobbi: “The girls help a&nbsp;lot in&nbsp;the kitchen. They like to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the cooking&nbsp;— and it’s mostly edible! And their dad’s really keen for the boys to&nbsp;know that you can’t go&nbsp;through life being given everything. Even if&nbsp;it’s just raking leaves or&nbsp;washing the car, there’s always something they can be&nbsp;doing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66d/293/11f49a5a82ac56d2e191a8681d.jpg><p>When the children were <a href=#>10&nbsp;years old</a>, the family ate about 4&nbsp;loaves of&nbsp;bread, 11&nbsp;liters of&nbsp;milk, and 6&nbsp;packs of&nbsp;cereal per week. Bobbi McCaughey tries to&nbsp;buy <a href=#>food</a> in&nbsp;advance to&nbsp;save money. The everyday life of&nbsp;a&nbsp;family of&nbsp;10&nbsp;people is&nbsp;a&nbsp;never-ending routine. So, now the McCaughey family has 2&nbsp;ovens, 2&nbsp;microwave ovens, 2&nbsp;dishwashers, 2&nbsp;washing machines and dryers, and their own land in&nbsp;the backyard for growing vegetables.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f9/01e/ca725f5402855d4f0bda89a20d.jpg><p>These siblings grew up&nbsp;unspoiled and used to&nbsp;hard work. All the children did pretty well in&nbsp;school and all of&nbsp;them played sports. Kelsey, Natalie, Alexis, Nathan, and Joel are <a href=#>studying</a> at&nbsp;Hannibal-Lagrange University, Kenny goes to&nbsp;college, and Brandon chose a&nbsp;military career and is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;get married soon. Kelsey is&nbsp;<a href=#>studying</a> public relations, Alexis is&nbsp;studying preschool education, Natalie is&nbsp;into sports, and Joel and Nathan are into computer science. Kenneth got his trade diploma in&nbsp;construction.</p><p>Kenny and Bobbi decided to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>move</a> into a&nbsp;smaller apartment, and the house with 7&nbsp;rooms where their children grew up&nbsp;was given to&nbsp;an&nbsp;organization that helps young mothers.</p><p>Naturally, over time, the attention toward the McCaughey family disappeared and journalists stopped bothering them. But we&nbsp;still remember the brave thing this young couple did when they disagreed with the medical advice that was presented to&nbsp;them and decided to&nbsp;have their 7&nbsp;children anyway. And we&nbsp;have no&nbsp;idea how many sleepless nights Bobbi McCaughey had, how many pieces of&nbsp;homework she had to&nbsp;check, or&nbsp;how she managed to&nbsp;buy Christmas presents for every child.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;the family that was able to&nbsp;raise 7&nbsp;children no&nbsp;matter what?</p><p><b>Please note</b>: This article was updated in June 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLmwu8pmmK1lpJ2ybr%2FEqauuqJyawbR51qGmrJ1dpa6zsc2tqmacmZm7tXnLoqqtnZ5iwbB5w6iaraeiqHpzfIyynJqqo2KuqLuMmqWdZZSasKqwxJ1kraddna63sYytn56lXWyEdX6QaWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flook-at-the-septuplets-whose-parents-didnt-listen-to-doctors-20-years-ago-and-decided-to-have-them-774210.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flook-at-the-septuplets-whose-parents-didnt-listen-to-doctors-20-years-ago-and-decided-to-have-them-774210.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flook-at-the-septuplets-whose-parents-didnt-listen-to-doctors-20-years-ago-and-decided-to-have-them-774210.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flook-at-the-septuplets-whose-parents-didnt-listen-to-doctors-20-years-ago-and-decided-to-have-them-774210.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flook-at-the-septuplets-whose-parents-didnt-listen-to-doctors-20-years-ago-and-decided-to-have-them-774210.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flook-at-the-septuplets-whose-parents-didnt-listen-to-doctors-20-years-ago-and-decided-to-have-them-774210.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./megan-rapinoe-world-cup-2023-interview-retirement.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./megan-rapinoe-world-cup-2023-interview-retirement.html>Megan Rapinoe Wants Equalityand a Third World Cup Title</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./le-thermometre-grimpe-les-collectivites-se-mobilisent.html>Le thermomtre grimpe, les collectivits se mobilisent</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./le-thermometre-grimpe-les-collectivites-se-mobilisent.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
