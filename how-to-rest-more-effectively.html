People who make true rest—not just sleep—part of their everyday routine have better outcomes across different aspects of their health. Their <a href=#>sleep quality</a> is better, <a href=#>life satisfaction</a> is higher, chronic pain is lessened, work productivity is greater, and <a href=#>they even tend to live longer.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The trouble is, rest usually gets pushed to the bottom of the to-do list. And if you fill your nights and weekends with exciting plans, your time off can be just as demanding and depleting as work.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here, experts share their tips for making the most of your downtime while also getting real, restorative rest.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The science of rest</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While the benefits of physical rest are well understood, there’s less research on how to optimize psychological rest. No perfect recipe for rest yet exists, but there are some basic principles that seem to work best.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One insight is that our brains and bodies seem to need different intervals of rest: short daily breaks and longer intervals weekly, says David Eccles, a professor of sports psychology at Florida State University who studies mental rest in elite athletes. “The most restful activities appear to be absorbing, of low cognitive demand, and inherently enjoyable,” he says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=#>Your Brain Doesn't Want You to Exercise</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This combination gives our brain a break. Whether it's a weekly yoga class or a daily game of breakroom ping pong, rest allows your brain to switch from active problem-solving to its daydreaming state. It's in these rest periods,&nbsp; “when you’re just sort of zoning out,” Eccles says, that your brain processes and stores information.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another thing we know about rest is that intermittent periods of mind-wandering and passive-rest are critical for memory and creativity. That’s why solutions and creative ideas often come unexpectedly during periods of rest or downtime, says Alex Pang, author of Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less. And the long-term impact of regular rest is greater productivity.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Take time off from (all) work</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Resting effectively is about more than getting away from the office. Lots of other things count as work, especially the activities we put off until the weekend, like grocery shopping, yard work, and cleaning.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“People say, “Of course I know how to use my free time,” says John Dattilo, a professor of recreation, parks, and tourism management at Penn State University who researches leisure. “In reality, we are struggling to rest.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In order to be rejuvenating, rest can’t be task-oriented, Dattilo says. It’s not a means to an end or productive. It doesn’t help you meet a certain expectation or fit in with a specific group. Even fun plans and self-care regimens lose their restorative abilities if we’re doing them for the wrong reason, like to seem remarkable, fit in, look cool on social media, or meet a beauty standard.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Part of rest is that you don’t feel beholden to external things you’re supposed to do,” Eccles says.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Real rest—or what Dattilo calls leisure—is freeing, meaningful, and specific to you. And oftentimes, the simplest&nbsp; activities offer the most rest, Eccles adds. A <a href=#>survey</a> of 18,000 people from 134 countries found that time in nature, listening to music, and reading for leisure were some of the most frequently listed resting activities.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Look for your joy</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rest is customizable, and the most important ingredient is that it’s a positive experience. What you do and when you do it matter less.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Your version of rest can be a stroll through the neighborhood after a long day, playing soccer with friends on the weekend, or Sunday baking. The key is that a restful activity helps you switch your focus from work—both paid and unpaid, says Eccles.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To find out what rests you, pay attention to how an activity makes you feel. If there’s a sense of drudgery or anxiety or meeting expectations—that’s not restful, Datillo says. But if something makes you feel joy or causes you to lose track of time, there’s a good chance it's restorative.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=#>6 Compliments That Land Every Time</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And rest shouldn’t cost a lot, says Katie Wical, a public health researcher at Loma Linda University in Calif. “Spending money increases your stress levels,” she says. This is why simple pleasures, like playing catch, recreating in nature, or sharing a meaningful conversation with a friend, can be more liberating than more extravagant forms of fun, says Wical.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s no coincidence that many different religions practice a day of rest. Taking time away from external demands helps us refocus on what’s most meaningful. Wical studies the sleep benefits of Sabbath, the Judeo-Christian practice of taking a whole day to rest each week. “I like to view the Sabbath as a weekly vacation day,” Wical says. In her 2023 study of Seventh Day Adventists, Wical’s team found that people who anticipated an upcoming Sabbath experienced better sleep quality and lower stress throughout the week.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">You don’t have to be alone to get good rest</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While resting may conjure images of a couch potato, that’s not what real rest looks like. In fact, experts agree that the scrolling and binge-watching we often revert to when we are “doing nothing” isn’t restful at all, because it diverts our attention and causes us to disengage.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Instead, a common theme for good rest is that it requires a person to be present, Eccles says. It’s about “attending to the current moment rather than ruminating about the past or thinking about the future.” For some people that might mean getting outside for a hike. For others, that might mean painting. Others may need more intense activities like rock climbing to separate from work and relieve stress, Wical adds.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=#>Are Personality Tests Actually Useful?</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In most cases, the best rest is active, not passive, says Pang.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Similarly, you don’t need to be home alone in silence to recharge your batteries. However you rest, it’s likely to become more effective and meaningful when you add other people, experts say.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A simple meal could be more fulfilling if you share it with close friends. Go fly fishing, but invite your dad. Even listening to music or reading a book becomes more meaningful when it leads to good conversation with the people around you, Dattilo says.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rest works best when it makes us feel connected.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Start small&nbsp;</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It shouldn’t be so hard to step away from work and do things that bring us joy with people we love. But experts warn that when you first start out, rest can feel uncomfortable, awkward, and even boring.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Because we live in a society where business is virtuous, resting can initially feel empty or aimless, Eccles says. “Start small,” Wical recommends.&nbsp; Rather than devoting an entire day to rest on the weekend, “it’s okay to start with just three hours.” It will help if you can invite your family, roommate, or friends to embark on rest with you. The people who see the most success practicing Sabbath, for example, do it alongside others, Wical says. The community aspect makes resting feel a little less like swimming upstream.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It may take a few tries before you start to really feel rejuvenated or even figure out how you prefer to rest, Pang says. That’s normal—and don’t quit on the first awkward try. “Rest is good because we are built for it,” he says, but that doesn’t mean it’ll come naturally.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWZuhHd9jqGmsGWkpHqzsdKtZKanopp6prLFnpqtoaaaubp7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-to-rest-more-effectively.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-to-rest-more-effectively.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-to-rest-more-effectively.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-to-rest-more-effectively.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-to-rest-more-effectively.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-rest-more-effectively.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./izzy-klein-the-almost-rabbi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./izzy-klein-the-almost-rabbi.html>Izzy Klein, the Almost-Rabbi - Morning Consult</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sports-de-nature-des-outils-juridiques-pour-perenniser-lacces-aux-lieux-de-pratique.html>des outils juridiques pour prenniser l'accs aux lieux de pratique</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sports-de-nature-des-outils-juridiques-pour-perenniser-lacces-aux-lieux-de-pratique.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
