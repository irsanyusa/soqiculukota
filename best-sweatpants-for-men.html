<time>25 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>As hard as it is to imagine, there was once a time when sweatpants were considered to be only suitable for the gym or lounging around at home. Now, though, sweatpants (and track suits) have become a common sight no matter where you are. Work from home and Covid may have exacerbated the trend, causing some previously suit-wearing and business casual types to rediscover their love of staying comfy, but there’s a whole swath of the population who has been embracing the athleisure trend. This is at least in part because sweatpants are no longer just baggy, gray, shapeless garments: There are dozens of styles, materials, and functions to choose from.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-sweatpants>How to choose sweatpants</h2><p>With so many choices, it may be difficult to decide just which pair (or two) of sweatpants you should invest in. To help you decide, consider the following things.</p><h3>Where do you plan to wear them?</h3><p>In general, and sort of by definition (they are supposedly pants to sweat in, after all) sweatpants have a loose fit, though there are slimmer cut options available. Slimmer silhouettes made from sleeker looking fabrics will look more appropriate for casual occasions, as opposed to heavy, baggy fleece styles or super lightweight pajama types, which are considered better suited for home lounging.</p><h3>Design features</h3><p>Most sweatpants have an elastic waistband with either an inner or outer drawcord or drawstring to cinch them in. Some have a straighter, trouser type leg, while others feature a tapered leg that ends in a cuff, either a wide band or elastic. Elastic cuffs are considered more old school, while ribbed cuffs lean more toward the trendy. Which you prefer is all down to your own personal style and what you feel comfortable in.</p><h3>Fabric type</h3><p>Classic sweatpants are made from French terry knit cotton. Some brands blend the cotton with spandex to add a bit of stretch, or with nylon for moisture wicking properties. Some are manufactured completely with synthetic materials to make them lightweight and breathable. If you’re actually going to be working out, you’ll probably want a pair made from something that will wick the sweat away from your body while also being breathable (ie: not necessarily 100% cotton).</p><p>With all that in mind, here are our top sweatpants picks for men (some of which you might even find on a list of best sweatpants for women—if only because they keep borrowing them from their brothers, friends, and partners).</p><h2 id=top-sweatpants-picks-for-men->Top sweatpants picks for men</h2><h3>The best budget sweatpants for men: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Hanes Men’s Jogger Sweatpants</a></h3><a rel=nofollow href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61He92WYpSL._AC_UX679_.jpg alt="Hanes Men’s Jogger Sweatpants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>For around $15, these cotton sweatpants from Hanes can’t be beat.

They’re one of the brands, along with Nike, who first made sweatpants “cool” or, at the very least, acceptable and even sometimes fashionable to wear outside the confines of a gym or track. These are made from a warm fleece that makes them super soft on the inside. You can’t go wrong with a pair of these. We even feel comfortable saying that they’ll never really go out of style. Tip: Adidas sizing is often unisex, so make sure to double-check the size chart before finalizing your purchase (if you need a refresher on getting the best fit, check out our guide on <a rel=alternate href=#>how to measure your waist for pants</a>).</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizing: XS – 3XL</li><li>Fabric: Cotton fleece, polyester, viscose</li><li>Style details: Elastic waist with drawstring, tapered legs with elastic cuffs</li><li>Pockets: Side pockets</li><li>Colors: Legend ink with white side stripes</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Extremely comfortable</li><li>Good quality; minimal color fading after multiple washings</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Too warm for summer days</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Most popular</span></p><p><h3 class=title>ESSENTIALS FLEECE TAPERED ELASTIC CUFF 3-STRIPES PANTS</h3></p><h3>The best elevated sweatpants for men: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Taylor Stitch Apres Pant Waffle</a></h3><a rel=nofollow href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.taylorstitch.com/cdn/shop/files/instock_m_q323_Apres_Pant_Black_Cherry_Sashiko_001_1200x.progressive.jpg alt="Taylor Stitch Apres Pant Waffle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>The waffle weave, fit, and front button fly allow you to take these sweatpants directly from the trail to a lunch date.

Both are made from a synthetic fabric blend. If you prefer the feel of cotton, you’ll probably consider something like the Everlane track pants to be the softest.</p><h3>What's the difference between joggers and sweatpants?</h3><p>Joggers have a tapered leg that ends in a stretchy or elasticized cuff of some kind, so your pant legs don’t get in your way while jogging. Personally, I consider joggers a type of sweatpants. Sweatpants can have wide, straight, or tapered legs and they don’t necessarily have to have cuffs on them.</p><h3>Are sweatpants fashionable on men?</h3><p>Sweatpants can be completely fashionable on men; it all depends on how you style them and what you wear them with. Darker colors (in a jogger cut) work better as an option for casual outings, especially when worn with a jean jacket or sweater and loafers.</p><h3>What brand makes the best sweatpants?</h3><p>All of the brands on this list make excellent sweatpants. Which one is the absolute best is completely subjective—though Nike, Hanes, Adidas, and Champion tend to be the most popular brands when it comes to sweatpants.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lo6yyosDPmqWtq12bvLN5zJ6laA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-sweatpants-for-men.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-sweatpants-for-men.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-sweatpants-for-men.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-sweatpants-for-men.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-sweatpants-for-men.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-sweatpants-for-men.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./loi-vieillissement-deux-rapports-sur-la-reforme-des-saad-et-le-baluchonnage.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./loi-vieillissement-deux-rapports-sur-la-reforme-des-saad-et-le-baluchonnage.html>deux rapports sur la rforme des Saad et le baluchonnage</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./social-media-usage-trust-statistics-chart-pack.html>2023 Social Media Usage and Trust Statistics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./social-media-usage-trust-statistics-chart-pack.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
