Apart from the small vertical strip housing the camera at the back, the display appears to have surrounded the entire phone. It is possible that this phone ushers a new era of all screen 4D surround display.</p><p class=align-left>Apart from the display, the phone comes surrounded by a very strong but lightweight Titanium frame. The vertical strip housing the camera is made of a black precision ceramic material. The triple cameras at the back also come protected from any form of scratching. Apart from housing the cameras, the vertical strip also houses the phone’s antennas as well as its connectivity modules for both Wi-Fi and 5G.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d5e8bca1b7600106.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>iPhone 7 review: Is it a good smartphone to buy?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Far from the excellent materials used in its construction, the phone is generally made with excellent design solutions for design-related challenges. For instance, instead of adding buttons on the side, the company chose to go with pressure-sensitive sides that work just as well.</p><h3>Display</h3><p class=align-left>There is a good reason why this phone will cost you more than many other phones would. It comes with a Snapdragon 855+ chipset and excellent storage comprising of 12 GB RAM and 512 GB ROM. Its battery is a 4,050 nano silicone cathode power cell with 40W wired fast-charging. Even with the already mentioned features, the phone still has more.</p><p class=align-left>The exciting part about it all is its display that goes all around the phone making it stand out. According to the company, it is this design that allows for the screen to body ratio of 180%. It even beats the Mate X foldable phone. The only difference is that with the Alpha, it is not possible to unwrap and get a continuous panel.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b8c0abc392f2a351.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting details about the Nokia 7</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The phone's panel has 2.15 mm thick bezels on both the top and bottom. It also has a camera strip on its back, not forgetting the lenses which are protected by a sapphire glass. It comes with pressure-sensitive edges. Although it does not have a speaker because of the ultrasonic proximity sensor, it still has audio due to the advanced Display Acoustic Technology. It also comes with palm rejection technology.</p><p class=align-left>The backside of the display has AI algorithms that detect Mi Home app use and that can be used when calling a cab and which can also come in handy whenever you need to pull up a flight itinerary.</p><p class=align-left>You can now enjoy backside selfies thanks to the 108 megapixels. The main camera has a huge 1/1.33” type sensor and Tetracell technology. This works in outputting 27MP pixel-binned shots.</p><p class=align-left>Looking at how sleek the phone is, one may easily assume that it is fragile. However, what they may not know is Xiaomi went out of its way to protect it by using a frame that is an aerospace-grade alloy. The phone's back strip is ceramic with a sapphire glass protection.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8a7124e840b8a3c9.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The good and bad about Xiaomi Redmi 8A</span></p></a><h3>Processor storage and performance</h3><p class=align-left>While not much of the processor details were revealed during the launch, it is known that the Snapdragon 855+ processor with 5G dual SIM support will be used. In addition to that, the phone comes with 12GB RAM as well as a 512GB of UFS 3.0 storage.</p><h3>Battery</h3><p class=align-left>It is also true that the battery is not a large one as it stands at 4050mAh. However, it supports 40W fast charging the same way the Mi 9 Pro 5G does.</p><h2>Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha software</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/19c6c503535f691e.jpg><p class=align-left>The internal working of a phone is majorly dependent on the software it has. Here are some of the software highlights that the new phone will come with.</p><h3>OS and features</h3><p class=align-left>The phone comes with a powerful Android 10; MIUI 11 for its operating system. In addition to this, it has a CPU Octa-core 1×2.96 GHz Kryo 485 & 3×2.42 GHz Kryo 485 & 4×1.8 GHz Kryo 485. Apart from this, it has a GPU Adreno 640 and a Qualcomm SDM855 Snapdragon 855+ (7 nm) chipset.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/eab454d8a8f49cae.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Google Pixel 4: Its fascinating specs, reviews, price and the official release date</span></p></a><h3>Camera, video, and image quality</h3><p class=align-left>The Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha camera features a 100MP+ resolution camera sensor. This is because of the Samsung ISOCELL Bright HMX 108MP camera sensor at the device's back. It is not surprising that the sensor will be appearing on this new Xiaomi phone since it was created in collaboration with Samsung.</p><p class=align-left>The primary camera, a 108MP, has a 1/1.33″ sensor. Its setup capacity has an output of 12032 x 9024-pixel resolution which makes images extremely detailed even with 8X cropping.</p><p class=align-left>The phone has 2 more sensors completing the triple camera. These are the 12MP telephoto camera which comes with 2X optical zoom as well as a 20MP ultra-wide-angle camera lens with 117° FOV. It is this setup that also supports and makes 1.5cm macro photography possible. In addition to the already mentioned features, other setup features include a Laser focus, a four-axis OIS, as well as a flicker sensor.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f467783ec8f01f96.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>An interesting guide to the amazing Xiaomi Mi 9 Pro 5G smartphone</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While the first set of photos from the camera look extremely detailed, we have to wait until the official release to know the quality of the real pictures. This phone has no selfie camera because it really does not need one. For your selfies, turn the phone and use the rear camera.</p><h3>Reviews</h3><p class=align-left>The release of the Mi Mix Alpha is an anticipated one as fans cannot wait to put their hands on it. While there may be a few concerns here and there, the majority of the comments about it have been positive. Here are some of people's sampled views on YouTube.</p><ul><li><i>Infinity Games: In future. Samsung adding new features. Xiaomi adding new features.

It is not surprising that it will be limited to China when released. This, therefore, means that to own one, you will need to pay so much more to have it shipped from China. The big question to ask yourself would be whether it is worth it or if you would rather settle for a cheaper alternative and forego the fancy look.</p><h2>Verdict</h2><p class=align-left>The Mi Mix Alpha appears to be priced differently. According<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> to gadgetstripe.com</a>, it will go for N995,000 or an equivalent $2974 when it is available for mass purchase later in December 2019. It should also be noted that the Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha price may keep changing with time.</p><p class=align-left>Most of Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha features are exceptional and make it a phone of its own kind in the market. However, the bottom line remains that this phone is not within the range of most people. It even becomes more difficult to get it when it will be finally released since it will be limited to China.</p><p class=align-left>To grab one for yourself, you have to decide whether or not you will be willing to spend thousands of dollars on it. So, the major concern would be where to buy Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha. To address this, gizmochina.com reveals that the phone has been listed for purchase in China but the possibility of people buying it is very limited because of the high cost.</p><p class=align-left>In the end, if you can afford it and you are a person who minds about a gadget's looks, the Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha would be a great buy.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnOCkm5wbmWonq6wuchmpKJlnZ7Fbq3LqZ%2BaZaOlsqS%2FjKucr6GVrHqxvsicnGaqlaGyor%2FEZpuarJVjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f1263595-xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-specs-review-price-release-date-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f1263595-xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-specs-review-price-release-date-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f1263595-xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-specs-review-price-release-date-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f1263595-xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-specs-review-price-release-date-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f1263595-xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-specs-review-price-release-date-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f1263595-xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-specs-review-price-release-date-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./18-actors-who-play-the-same-role-in-every-movie-637360.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./18-actors-who-play-the-same-role-in-every-movie-637360.html>18Actors Who Play the Same Role inEvery Movie</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-justin-bieber-update-after-his-facial-paralysis-diagnosis-816916.html>What Happened to Justin Bieber: Update After His Facial Paralysis Diagnosis</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happened-to-justin-bieber-update-after-his-facial-paralysis-diagnosis-816916.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
