As&nbsp;hilarious as&nbsp;it&nbsp;seems, it&nbsp;might indicate something quite dangerous! One woman detailed such a&nbsp;story online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/802/a89/7a2a3b568aa52c2e46cc78bf3e.png><p>At&nbsp;first, she just thought she had been pranked by&nbsp;some neighborhood kid. She decided to&nbsp;call a&nbsp;friend and ask for help with cleaning the car. But once the two ladies started removing the melted cheese, they noticed something strange two parking spots down from them.</p><p>They remembered seeing a&nbsp;white van arriving. In&nbsp;it, there was a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;men staring at&nbsp;them. Since she wasn’t alone, the woman decided to&nbsp;finish cleaning the car, even though the ladies didn’t feel <a href=# title=comfortable data-link=tag>comfortable</a> being watched. It&nbsp;took them almost an&nbsp;hour to&nbsp;scrape off the cheese that had already melted under the heat of&nbsp;the sun.</p><p>She did wonder, though, if&nbsp;this wasn’t a&nbsp;tactic to&nbsp;rob a&nbsp;person. Because most people would be&nbsp;so&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;cleaning up&nbsp;the mess on&nbsp;their car that they would be&nbsp;too distracted to&nbsp;keep an&nbsp;eye on&nbsp;their belongings. Or&nbsp;worse, what if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;kidnapping strategy since you wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see suspicious people coming at&nbsp;you in&nbsp;due course?</p><p>She went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;recommend: if&nbsp;you ever see a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;cheese on&nbsp;your car, just leave&nbsp;it. Your safest bet is&nbsp;to&nbsp;scrub it&nbsp;off at&nbsp;home. Or&nbsp;take your vehicle to&nbsp;the nearest car wash. They’ll know the best way to&nbsp;remove it&nbsp;without ruining the paint.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/da9/7e6/8c12625635807213042cab684c.png><p>The slice of&nbsp;cheese may have easily been a&nbsp;coincidence. But some scams out there are even more imaginative. If&nbsp;you notice a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;clothing on&nbsp;your windshield or&nbsp;wrapped between your wiper blades, don’t hurry to&nbsp;take it&nbsp;away. Again, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;strategically placed there to&nbsp;distract you while your car gets taken away.</p><p>The best option is&nbsp;to&nbsp;drive away as&nbsp;quickly as&nbsp;possible and get to&nbsp;a&nbsp;safe location&nbsp;— it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;well-lit and populated. Then you can safely remove the objects placed on&nbsp;your car. Some people have even found money under their wipers. It&nbsp;was probably placed there with the same intent in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>Here’s a&nbsp;method some people swear by&nbsp;when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;decreasing the odds of&nbsp;getting your car snatched away. Keep the tires turned toward the curb when parked. That’s because when your car wheels are positioned like that, thieves are less likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;maneuver the vehicle. This way, your car will require more time and energy to&nbsp;be&nbsp;moved. And it&nbsp;will less likely become the focus of&nbsp;theft.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/91f/6ff/b9d66b507db85a1f5491c3babc.png><p>Another woman remembered finding a&nbsp;napkin under her car door handle at&nbsp;one point. But at&nbsp;that time, she didn’t think much of&nbsp;it. She removed it&nbsp;and went on&nbsp;with her day. However, a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;hours later, she ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a>, complaining about pain in&nbsp;her hand and shortness of&nbsp;breath. Doctors figured out she had been poisoned with an&nbsp;unknown substance!</p><p>Unfortunately, scams are becoming more and more common these days, with online ones topping the list. You may be&nbsp;the subject of&nbsp;a&nbsp;phishing scam, for example, when you receive an&nbsp;email from someone who seems familiar. It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;your accountant, someone from work, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;retailer you often buy from.</p><p>But if&nbsp;you look closely at&nbsp;the email address, you’ll easily notice that something is&nbsp;off. It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;just one edited letter or&nbsp;a&nbsp;name spelled differently. These types of&nbsp;emails can ask various things from you. Anything from private information, such as&nbsp;addresses and passwords, to&nbsp;payment requests.</p><p>Others offer coupons or&nbsp;gift cards&nbsp;— if&nbsp;you click on&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain website, it&nbsp;may actually hack your computer. This is&nbsp;probably the most common online scam these days. Authorities claim that over 114,700 people fell victim to&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;2019. Their losses were estimated at&nbsp;roughly $57.8&nbsp;million!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/095/130/9ba6b95125ac720a812ebaadbd.png><p>Then there are fake shopping websites. To&nbsp;make sure you’re always on&nbsp;the right one, check the URL carefully. If&nbsp;the website reads Amaz0n.com, you’re obviously not in&nbsp;the right place, and you are probably about to&nbsp;get scammed. You can buy something from these websites, but the chances are you’ll receive either nothing or&nbsp;— the best-case scenario&nbsp;— a&nbsp;fake item.</p><p>Ever heard of&nbsp;formjacking? It&nbsp;happens when a&nbsp;retailer gets hacked. And once you’ve finished adding things to&nbsp;your cart during a&nbsp;shopping session, you’re actually redirected to&nbsp;a&nbsp;fraudulent payment page. The scammer then has access to&nbsp;your payment information, like your name, address, and credit card details. To&nbsp;always be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the safe side, double-check the URL of&nbsp;the payment page before entering any sensitive information.</p><p>Tech support scams are even more creative. With this one, you might even receive a&nbsp;phone call saying that your computer is&nbsp;infected with a&nbsp;dangerous virus which may damage your device or&nbsp;destroy all the information stored on&nbsp;it. The scammer may then ask you to&nbsp;download an&nbsp;application that will give them access to&nbsp;your computer, even if&nbsp;they’re located on&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;the world. Then they’ll download an&nbsp;actual virus on&nbsp;the computer to&nbsp;confirm their lie. It&nbsp;makes people think there’s indeed something wrong with the computer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9ed/dfc/8095fa5bbb84c588a32cac5b13.png><p>The next and final step? Asking for a&nbsp;fee to&nbsp;fix&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;you suspect your device might be&nbsp;compromised, always reach out to&nbsp;a&nbsp;trusted tech support or&nbsp;retailer. These types of&nbsp;businesses will never contact you out of&nbsp;the blue. This scam tends to&nbsp;appeal to&nbsp;people’s <a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a>, targeting mostly the older generation.</p><p>That’s why it’s also dubbed “the grandparent scam.” The targeted senior will most likely receive a&nbsp;phone call from a&nbsp;distressed person, claiming they’re a&nbsp;grandchild or&nbsp;a&nbsp;close relative. The fraudster will then proceed to&nbsp;ask for money for various things, like to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;jail, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;leave a&nbsp;foreign country, or&nbsp;to&nbsp;cover a&nbsp;hospital bill.</p><p>Grandparent scams are really on&nbsp;the rise these days: in&nbsp;2017, the losses from such scams added up&nbsp;to&nbsp;$26&nbsp;million. But in&nbsp;2018, they almost doubled, reaching $41&nbsp;million! If&nbsp;you find yourself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar situation, try not to&nbsp;act immediately. Ask the person for some information that could help you verify their identity. Also, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good idea to&nbsp;double-check with another family member before sending money to&nbsp;a&nbsp;stranger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/77a/1d6/8ec70c54009d529bf1c899ce99.png><p>The Google voice scam is&nbsp;as&nbsp;easy as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;efficient. For scammers, of&nbsp;course. Here’s what you should look out for. You might have posted your phone number on&nbsp;some website for various reasons: maybe you’re looking to&nbsp;sell something or&nbsp;offering to&nbsp;perform a&nbsp;service. The fraudsters will pick up&nbsp;on&nbsp;this information and rapidly call you, asking to&nbsp;verify if&nbsp;you aren’t a&nbsp;scammer yourself&nbsp;— talk about reverse psychology!</p><p>You’ll be&nbsp;asked to&nbsp;pass on&nbsp;a&nbsp;Google verification code. In&nbsp;reality, a&nbsp;Google Voice account is&nbsp;being set up&nbsp;in&nbsp;your name. Fraudsters can go&nbsp;on&nbsp;with their scams and pretend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;you while doing&nbsp;it, using the newly created account. Rule number&nbsp;1: never share verification codes with anyone! Online resumes aren’t safe either, as&nbsp;they can offer personal information to&nbsp;scammers.</p><p>They will try to&nbsp;contact you, pretending to&nbsp;be&nbsp;recruiters. Some might even take the time to&nbsp;conduct a&nbsp;job interview! Most of&nbsp;them pretend to&nbsp;offer high-paying positions, which you’ll obviously be&nbsp;inclined to&nbsp;accept. But here’s the catch: before they can offer you the documents for employment, you’ll be&nbsp;asked for money for some participation fee or&nbsp;even for your future home-office setup.</p><p>To&nbsp;make sure you’re always on&nbsp;the safe side, create a&nbsp;different email address which you’ll only use for job hunting. This way, you can keep your personal email unlisted and safe from any unwanted online scams. Always ask recruiters to&nbsp;confirm the information you’ve heard on&nbsp;the phone via email too. If&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;company you’re familiar with, you can also reach out to&nbsp;their&nbsp;HR department to&nbsp;confirm that what you’re asked to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;according to&nbsp;their policy.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLanediorGarlZp6onnSpaCcnV2ks26vx56crJ1dpLtuxc6uqWabkad6rbvCpGSirF2Wu6V5y56Yr51dbX51hJBvZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fif-you-see-a-slice-of-cheese-on-your-car-lock-it-and-leave-814816.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fif-you-see-a-slice-of-cheese-on-your-car-lock-it-and-leave-814816.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fif-you-see-a-slice-of-cheese-on-your-car-lock-it-and-leave-814816.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fif-you-see-a-slice-of-cheese-on-your-car-lock-it-and-leave-814816.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fif-you-see-a-slice-of-cheese-on-your-car-lock-it-and-leave-814816.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fif-you-see-a-slice-of-cheese-on-your-car-lock-it-and-leave-814816.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./james-blake-lil-yachty-bad-cameo-album-review-1236049988.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./james-blake-lil-yachty-bad-cameo-album-review-1236049988.html>James Blake and Lil Yachty Make an Odd but Unexpectedly Strong Couple on Bad Cameo: Albu</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./i-loved-lucy-1117943814.html>I Loved Lucy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./i-loved-lucy-1117943814.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
