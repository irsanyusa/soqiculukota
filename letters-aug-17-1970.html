Nothing could be further from the truth. As your own article points out, the Aleuts, Eskimos and Indians of Alaska have only a life expectancy of 35 years, and most live broken, impoverished lives. Nothing is more savage, cruel or capable of breaking a man’s spirit than unbridled nature. It is based on violence, with one animal eating another, and its quick violent storms can break a man in a minute. Not everything nature does is right or the best. Man must tame and change it if he is to survive. I think that it’s good to remember that, with all our pollution, our life expectancy isn’t 35.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JOSEPH RADINSKY Lafayette, Ind.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: Congratulations on your excellent coverage of Alaska’s environmental and development problems. It is one of the most comprehensive articles on this situation to appear in a national magazine to date.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are many Alaskans who deplore the thoughtless rush towards resource exploitation. We do not object to carefully planned and regulated development, but we don’t want to sell the last unspoiled environment for a handful of dollars.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">RAY BANE Hughes, Alaska</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: The Senate offer of $1 billion to the Alaskan natives for 350 million acres is $2.82 per acre. What Congressman would sell his land for that when there is oil under some of it? Compare this to the revenue of the state of Alaska: already $900 million by leasing to oil companies the 434,000 acres on the North Slope (legally liberated from the natives) and a potential $200 million per year from pipeline oil royalties and taxes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">R. EDWARD BROWN Highland Park, Mich.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: With its $900 million, Alaska’s state government might well consider sending all its citizens on an inspection tour of the grimy and dreary industrial communities that adjoin Jersey City, N.J., or Gary, Ind. Such shock treatment, hopefully, might send Alaskans home more willing to resist the appeals of union leaders and Chambers of Commerce when they promise profits and progress, seemingly without cost.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">DARRELL KRISTO Valparaiso, Ind.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: First it was the Gold Rush, then it was the Copper Rush, now it is the Oil Rush. After we drain Alaska of all its natural resources, who are we going to sell it to?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">KEVIN BOURQUE Boston</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: Trapper Joe Delia has only to look at himself to see why “people can’t live out like they used to.” Mr. Delia, who would trap wild animals for their pelts and who would net thousands of salmon “just to feed our teams,” is no better than the oil companies who would ruin Alaska’s fragile ecology.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">SCOTT SWANSON Daly City, Calif.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Look Homeward</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: No one who has been laid off recently will be impressed by business’s efforts as social activists [July 20]. Corporations are themselves societies and must behave responsibly to their own membership before Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” will guide employees to optimize customer and stockholder interests. No responsible society from nation down to family ejects members to cut costs. To do so destroys loyalty and teamwork.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">DR. WILLIAM M. WALLACE Buckley, Wash.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: What more can business do? Instead of using money to duplicate Government programs such as Job Corps or Head Start, it can show Government how to reorganize existing agencies along a corporate model, so that results are more effective. Business and foundations should join to establish new models for welfare programs, without the drag of politics and often conflicting legislation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Government has the funds to dispense, but does not have the money to change its structure, which is the greatest obstacle in solving the problems of poverty and urban ills. A tight corporate approach will serve a Government in disarray best because it will show what can be done. Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” should lead business to reform the Government in “human profit” efficiency because effective government is the best way to cure a sick society.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">DANIEL E. CHARBONEAU Annandale, Va.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: Nothing short of a basic change in attitude—one that places the human condition above the G.N.P.—will suffice if we are to fashion a society attaching greater worth to quality than to quantity.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I have no sympathy for those corporate laggards who transact business as usual, waiting for the governmental whip to prod them into action. If big business needs guidance in formulating social acceptance programs, why doesn’t it seek out political and social scientists and ecologists with the same zeal it displays in wooing accountants and engineers?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The consumer can do his part by consciously patronizing those firms which are not bent on a cleanup of the public but are making a determined effort to clean up their effluents.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There is one internal stimulus that industry does respond to most expeditiously: an unfavorable profit-and-loss statement. An enlightened buying public can help prevent America’s socio-ecological crisis from becoming a fait accompli.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JOSEPH C. DAVIS JR. Norfolk, Va.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hard Sell</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: I take issue with your ascribing an underlying motive to the President in refusing to consult Congress before ordering military incursions into Cambodia [July 13]. His answer, though unmistakably concise and logical, is dismissed as not “apt.” A responsible Commander in Chief does not inform the enemy of the time and location of an impending attack. I think you will find that a decided majority of troops, officers and high commanders will bear me out on the efficacy and soundness of this policy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HAROLD B. GREEN Garland, Texas</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Appreciation of Artistry</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: Thank you for that fine article on Bessie Smith [Aug. 3]. Few white people appreciated her artistry while she was alive, and the black people with whom she communicated so directly in the ’20s forsook her kind of blues as the Swing Era approached. The current black awareness includes a proud backward glance and an embracing by black people of their heritage. Miss Smith, too long an unsung musical force, is an important part of that heritage. Her rediscovery by black youth is, I believe, a factor that accounts for much of the current reissue’s success.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I was bothered by the reference to me as a “Blues Expert.” I have never considered myself a blues expert. In fact, I believe the only experts in that field are the performers themselves.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">CHRIS ALBERTSON Manhattan</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Foundation of the Problem</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: Nothing I’ve read recently has delighted me more than your article “Do Cities Really Need Dogs?” [July 20]. New York needs them the way it needs dirtier streets and parks. For years I’ve been crusading against this horrendous problem with virtually every department in the city. If something isn’t done soon, we’ll all wake up one day to a new foundation —made up entirely of dog dirt.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">(MRS.) DORIS J. PEARSALL Manhattan</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: TIME’s article suggests that city dwellers have taken advantage of man’s best friend by forcing him into an environment literally not fit for a dog.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">GEORGE E. TALMAGE Indianapolis</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: Would it not be more worthwhile to discuss the problems caused by (and the virtues of “curbing”) the excessive human population and its incessant reproduction? Does the world really need people, or shall we begin shooting them? (PFC.) ROBERT B. KEISER Okinawa</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">How to Spike a Bike</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: How fortunate that cyclists in Manhattan can bring their bikes into their offices [July 27]. The insurance company I work for in San Francisco would not allow me to leave my three-speed Raleigh in the employees’ garage overnight when there was a sudden rainstorm at quitting time. The company’s reasoning was that the bicycle was likely to “fall over and damage an employee’s automobile.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">KAREN SMITH San Francisco</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vbWtjbYZwuMStq56qo2KutrOMam5maWlsfXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fletters-aug-17-1970.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fletters-aug-17-1970.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fletters-aug-17-1970.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fletters-aug-17-1970.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fletters-aug-17-1970.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fletters-aug-17-1970.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./matthew-perry-cause-of-death-ketamine-1235772053.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./matthew-perry-cause-of-death-ketamine-1235772053.html>Matthew Perrys Cause of Death Revealed as Acute Effects of Ketamine</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pollution-de-lair-le-plan-national-dactions-2022-2025-est-paru.html>le plan national dactions &amp;quot;2022-2025&amp;quot; est paru</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pollution-de-lair-le-plan-national-dactions-2022-2025-est-paru.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
