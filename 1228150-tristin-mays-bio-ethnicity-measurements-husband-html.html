Her parents are Viveca and Michael Mays. Currently, she is 28 years old, but she may look much younger. Tristin Mays nationality is not so clear from her birthplace. Although she was born in America, she has mixed roots. The actress specified under one of her photos on her Instagram that she is African American-French-Indian. Such an unusual mixture makes her a gorgeous woman with a peculiar eye cut and marvellous tanned skin.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e83e3c7c6b835ff7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything you need to know about the gorgeous model and YouTuber Erika Costell</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As it has already been said, Tristin was introduced into show business as a child and debuted as a model.

Their single<i> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Screensaver</a></i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> was released</a> by Marques Houston and T-Pain.</p><p class=align-left>In life, she is believed to be not only a talented actress but also an animal lover. As a celebrity who has a significant impact on social media, she gave her opinion cncerning China's dog meat trade. She wrote:</p>“Before everyone starts arguing, this includes the fur industry, INHUMANE KILLING OF FARM ANIMALS, and all other forms of animal abuse. No animal deserves to be abused. This post, in particular, is to bring awareness to the animal cruelty many people have no clue about. In China, they believe the more pain and fear the dogs have before killing them makes the meat taste better. No this is not a tradition. This trend started in 2010. Not to mention 80% of the dogs are stolen/kidnapped out of peoples yards and properties. Thank you to @helpbanyulin and the other rescues in China for your tireless efforts in rescuing so many dogs per day. Please visit her page and donate so she can continue to run her overflowing rescue shelter. Spread the word and help stop animal abuse WORLDWIDE. Thanks for reading.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8143f0b5757d23e7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All the interesting facts about the gorgeous Charlize Theron</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The post also consisted of real videos that may be considered too cruel by some readers.

In 2015, the first pieces of evidence of her romantic connection with the famous footballer DeAndre Yedlin appeared.</p><p class=align-left>Mays posted many similar photos, and they even appeared on several public events together. The actress even said that Yedlin was her favourite footballer. She also made a shoot with his portrait and captioned it:</p>“He made my day so special all the way from Mexico. Thank you.”<p class=align-left>So for those who follow the public lives of these two lovers, everything was quite evident.
