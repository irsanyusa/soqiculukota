It’s true that feeling confident about your irresistibility is&nbsp;half of&nbsp;the success. There are many examples of&nbsp;women who got the reputation of&nbsp;heart-stealers and fatal beauties but who in&nbsp;fact were far from the beauty ideal. Still, men and the whole world would fall to&nbsp;their feet exclusively thanks to&nbsp;their ability to&nbsp;present themselves.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have carefully looked through memoirs and archives, hoping to&nbsp;reveal the secrets that helped ordinary girls leave a&nbsp;huge mark on&nbsp;history.</p><p><h2>1. Marlene Dietrich</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e9/043/06780b5350a96d76bc08b21fd9.jpg><p>A&nbsp;plump German girl, who had no&nbsp;hint of&nbsp;the slim body shape that the gorgeous Marlene Dietrich had, with a&nbsp;typical face, simply couldn’t become a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> world. Her voluminous hips, the cheekbones of&nbsp;a&nbsp;commoner, and an&nbsp;upturned nose were far from the beauty ideals of&nbsp;that time. Before filming in&nbsp;the movie The Blue Angel, which brought her world <a href=#>fame</a>, <strong>Marlene Dietrich had to&nbsp;work hard on&nbsp;her appearance.</strong></p><p>First of&nbsp;all, the director made her maintain a&nbsp;strict <a href=# title=diet data-link=tag>diet</a>, her brows were plucked out in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;thin arch, and her hair was dyed. What’s more, they enhanced the languid heaviness of&nbsp;her eyelids, her face later developed sunken cheekbones that gave Dietrich that special charm. However, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed that the actress had to&nbsp;get several of&nbsp;her molars <a href=#>removed</a> to&nbsp;get this effect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/521/90c/2e9dc953c8a2597d3751c0b676.jpg><p>Relationships with men were a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;a&nbsp;game for Marlene Dietrich. She had a&nbsp;box at&nbsp;home where she kept letters from numerous lovers. <strong>Marlene easily broke the hearts of&nbsp;men</strong>, who remained grateful for the rest of&nbsp;their lives, rejoicing in&nbsp;the happiness that they were lucky to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;have her in&nbsp;their life. Erich Maria Remarque, Jean Gabin, and Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. —&nbsp;none of&nbsp;them could <a href=#>resist</a> the diva’s captivating charm. Ernest Hemingway, who was also in&nbsp;love with her, once <a href=#>said</a>, “If&nbsp;she had nothing more than her voice, she could break your heart with&nbsp;it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c30/559/a0172b5e1ca71471cc49ffd2e3.jpg><p><h2>2. Liza Minnelli</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/964/91d/65d2225614b827d1a9d5666278.jpg><p>Though her<strong> round face and a&nbsp;snubbed nose</strong> in&nbsp;no&nbsp;way outlined any hint of&nbsp;aristocracy in&nbsp;Liza, still, her deep black eyes, that were aglow with sadness gave Liza a&nbsp;special charm. She refused the help of&nbsp;her famous parents (who were an&nbsp;actress and a&nbsp;director in&nbsp;Hollywood) and started to&nbsp;coin her destiny by&nbsp;herself: she worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model, give solo concerts, and she patiently waited for her finest hour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aac/82e/55cba0517b9fd79b83afbc1516.jpg><p>Her world fame <a href=#>started</a> with the movie Cabaret where she played the singer Sally Bowles. A&nbsp;hat, a&nbsp;bow tie, fishnets, and a&nbsp;witchy, slightly vicious look&nbsp;— this unforgettable image helped her find her way into the hearts of&nbsp;many men. Her love affairs were widely gossiped about in&nbsp;Hollywood society. Once, Martin Scorsese’s wife <strong>applied for a&nbsp;divorce, having called Liza Minnelli the reason</strong>. However, each of&nbsp;Liza’s 4&nbsp;<a href=# title=marriages data-link=tag>marriages</a> ended in&nbsp;divorce too.</p><p><h2>Liza Minnelli and her husband Peter Allen, 1967</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/418/b24/cd953655d69e52f532ef4fa242.jpg><p><h2>3. Édith Piaf</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e2f/ba7/9b96cc5639ab40a74dd87122fe.jpg><p>The woman with the voice of&nbsp;an&nbsp;angel that bewitched millions of&nbsp;people and caused tears of&nbsp;admiration was <a href=#>called</a> “a&nbsp;sparrow” in&nbsp;real life. <strong><a href=#>Sometimes</a> she was even called “a&nbsp;lizard” due to&nbsp;her small hands</strong>. Her first marriage took place when the singer <a href=#>was</a> 17&nbsp;years old&nbsp;— she married the owner of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small shop. One year later, Piaf gave birth to&nbsp;their daughter, who soon died of&nbsp;meningitis. After having lost the baby, Édith broke up&nbsp;with her husband and had no&nbsp;more children.</p><p class=adme-img-description>Edith Piaf and Marcel Cerdan</p><p>After that, she met the love of&nbsp;her life&nbsp;— French <a href=#>boxer</a>, Marcel Cerdan. But he&nbsp;was married and had 3&nbsp;kids. Still, he&nbsp;would rush to&nbsp;his “sparrow” whenever she called, even to&nbsp;the edges of&nbsp;the earth for her. Unfortunately, this impulse tragically stopped his life. One year after starting the affair with Piaf, Cerdan was flying to&nbsp;see her from Paris to&nbsp;New York when his airplane crashed.</p><p>Édith Piaf had <strong><a href=#>many</a> love affairs within her life that she would start and stop</strong> without any regrets. Once she started to&nbsp;realize her feelings were cooling down, she would stop the affair and go&nbsp;on&nbsp;searching for new adventures. Even shortly before her death, Édith <a href=#>married</a> a&nbsp;26-year-old hairdresser.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/605/2e5/9d493b5936a961a2af463d3e44.jpg><p>Théo Sarapo was the actress’s second husband. The singer <a href=#>renounced</a> Catholicism so&nbsp;that, according to&nbsp;Théo’s wishes, their wedding could take place in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Greek church. Édith died one year later and he&nbsp;inherited her debts&nbsp;— around 7&nbsp;million Francs, which caused him to&nbsp;lose his apartment.</p><p><h2>4. Frida Kahlo</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dfd/d64/9926235af9905848a4ed660462.jpg><p>Her appearance was far from the ideal of&nbsp;beauty, but it&nbsp;still attracted men and women. The girl’s left leg was thinner than her right one due to&nbsp;the fact that she <a href=#>had</a> polio in&nbsp;her childhood. Frida hid this imperfection behind long skirts. Nevertheless, Frida looked impressive, <strong>she was an&nbsp;incredibly charismatic person</strong>: bushy eyebrows, black hair styled in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bun, and always decorated with bright flowers. She collected Mexican national outfits and dressed up&nbsp;brightly, creating the image of&nbsp;a&nbsp;total badass.</p><p class=adme-img-description>Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera in&nbsp;Mexico</p><p>Frida married the famous Mexican artist Diego Rivera, who was 20&nbsp;years older than her. Her husband unfolded her talent in&nbsp;painting. They broke up&nbsp;several times but got back together repeatedly. <strong>Frida <a href=#>had</a> many love affairs including Leon Trotsky</strong>, a&nbsp;Russian revolutionary. But she was psychologically dependent on&nbsp;Diego Rivera and stayed with him despite his infidelities.</p><p><h2>5. Lilya Brik</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/65b/b9d/e96dd6578bb466e8ea0d80c1db.jpg><p>She was suspected of&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;“ménage à&nbsp;trois” (an&nbsp;arrangement in&nbsp;which a&nbsp;married couple and the lover of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them live together). She wasn’t perfect and didn’t hide&nbsp;it, and yet she knew how to&nbsp;behave in&nbsp;society and adored the attention. Many people didn’t see the beauty in&nbsp;Lilya but when she smiled, the real magic began.</p><p>This memory about her <a href=#>speaks</a> for itself, “The first impression about Lilya was “Oh&nbsp;my&nbsp;god, <strong>she is&nbsp;ugly, she had a&nbsp;big head and slouches</strong>... But she smiled at&nbsp;me&nbsp;and her whole face started to&nbsp;shine, I&nbsp;saw a&nbsp;gorgeous woman in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;me: huge hazelnut eyes, a&nbsp;beautifully shaped mouth, and almond teeth. She had a&nbsp;charm that attracted others at&nbsp;first glance.”</p><p>When Lilya passed&nbsp;by, people would look at&nbsp;her: red hair, bright makeup, huge brown eyes. They didn’t know who she was but still realized that this woman was incredible. Still, Lilya didn’t see herself through rose-colored glasses&nbsp;— <strong>she realized she had imperfections </strong>and would hide them behind clothing.</p><p>Here is&nbsp;what her stepson’s wife Inna Gens-Katanyan would <a href=#>say</a> about her, “Her body shape wasn’t the best. She had thin legs that she would carefully hide behind long skirts and trousers. She was the first woman in&nbsp;Moscow who started to&nbsp;wear trousers. Her sense of&nbsp;style was outstanding. But her mystical charm was mainly in&nbsp;the fact that she was a&nbsp;perfect conversationalist. When talking to&nbsp;a&nbsp;man, she would sink into him and start to&nbsp;live with his interests. Which man wouldn’t like that?”</p><p><h2>Lilya Brik and Vladimir Mayakovsky in Yalta</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c42/483/b6872851b1ae9c104880545da2.jpg><p><h2>6. Mata Hari</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eea/c8d/5a2bee57d6af3665fa9cdba822.jpg><p>From her very childhood, Margaretha Geertruida Zelle dreamt about <strong>a&nbsp;luxury life that had no&nbsp;place for boredom</strong>. So&nbsp;she <a href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;make her dream come true with the help of&nbsp;men. She found her future husband, Dutch Colonial Army Captain Rudolf MacLeod, using an&nbsp;announcement, married him, and moved to&nbsp;Indonesia. The marriage was a&nbsp;complete disappointment for both of&nbsp;them, so&nbsp;they decided to&nbsp;break&nbsp;up.</p><p>Finding herself on&nbsp;the verge of&nbsp;poverty, the girl went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;earn a&nbsp;living in&nbsp;Paris. This is&nbsp;when her fame as&nbsp;an&nbsp;“eastern style” dancer with the nickname Mata Hari <a href=#>began</a>. Some of&nbsp;her performances were something close to&nbsp;a&nbsp;modern striptease. The immodest diva was invited to&nbsp;the best theaters in&nbsp;Europe. One wealthy patron was replaced by&nbsp;another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dad/5e8/99149655e2be260c0bae65d9e1.jpg><p>During the war, Germans decided <strong>to&nbsp;use this pretty dancer as&nbsp;a&nbsp;spy</strong>. However, she <a href=#>started</a> to&nbsp;work for both sides in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;earn more money. She would sell information about Germans to&nbsp;the French and vice versa. Soon Mata Hari was arrested. At&nbsp;the trial, everyone sympathized with her, men were sending requests for clemency to&nbsp;the court, her lawyer, who was also her lover, even knelt in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the judge. But that didn’t save her. On&nbsp;July&nbsp;25, 1917, this spy was sentenced to&nbsp;death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6df/de5/fc918052ecba0c5c6b82fd98e6.jpg><p>Obviously, visual beauty is&nbsp;not enough to&nbsp;help anyone to&nbsp;succeed.
