He is also the founder of Young Money Entertainment.</p><p>Born in New Orleans, his entrance to the music industry came at the young age of 11 when he joined Cash Money Records, starting a career that would span decades. He had early success in a group project with Hot Boys, followed by his multi-platinum debut solo album Tha Block Is Hot in 1999.</p><p>Growing up in the Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans, Carter experienced a challenging childhood. At the age of two, his parents divorced, and he was subsequently raised by his mother, a cook, who had him when she was just 19 years old. Carter's father abandoned the family, leaving his stepfather Reginald "Rabbit" McDonald to be the man he considered his real father.</p><p>Carter was a bright student who was placed in a gifted program at Lafayette Elementary School and later attended Eleanor McMain Secondary School. However, he dropped out at age 14 to dedicate himself to music. At 12 years old, Carter endured a self-inflicted gunshot wound, which he later characterized as a suicide attempt.</p><p>Carter's early career saw him join Hot Boys in 1997, with their debut project Get It How U Live! quickly followed by Guerrilla Warfare in 1999. His own breakout project, Tha Block Is Hot, also released in 1999, went platinum. Subsequent albums Lights Out in 2000, and 500 Degreez in 2002, continued to build his reputation, with the former achieving gold certification.</p><p>Between 2004 and 2006, Carter released Tha Carter and Tha Carter II, which demonstrated his developing talents. During this period, he also collaborated with mentor Birdman on the album Like Father, Like Son in 2006. His mixtapes and features on tracks like "Gimme That" by <a href=#>Chris Brown</a> and "Make It Rain" by Fat Joe maintained his momentum as a rising star.</p><p>Tha Carter III, released in 2008, became a landmark achievement for Carter, selling over a million copies in its first week and earning him four Grammy Awards. He followed up with We Are Young Money, a collaborative effort from his label's roster in 2009, and his experimental rock-influenced album Rebirth in 2010. I Am Not a Human Being and Tha Carter IV were also released during this period, with the latter selling 964,000 copies in its initial week.</p><p>After announcing Tha Carter V in 2014, Carter faced legal battles with Cash Money Records, which delayed its release. He subsequently released the Free Weezy Album in 2015 and finally Tha Carter V in 2018, marking the resolution of his contract issues. In 2020, Funeral debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, and as of 2023, Carter had released the single "Kat Food" while working on Tha Carter VI.</p><p>In his personal life, Carter has four children with different mothers, and while he's been engaged multiple times, he has not married. His health has been a topic of concern due to several seizures attributed to a neurological condition, which he openly addresses.</p><p>His philanthropic work includes the One Family Foundation, and he's delved into various business ventures like the cannabis industry and sports media. In 2021, he was pardoned by President <a href=#>Donald Trump</a>, following a series of legal issues, including arrests and lawsuits.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>September 27</a>, <a href=#>1982</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> New Orleans, Louisiana, USA<br><b>Age: <a href=#>41 years old</a></b></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Millennial</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Dog</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Libra</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><br><h2>Career Highlights</h2><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Rappers</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwuMilZLCZqaOy</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flil-wayne.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flil-wayne.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flil-wayne.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flil-wayne.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flil-wayne.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flil-wayne.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./35957-most-consumers-trust-review-sites.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./35957-most-consumers-trust-review-sites.html>Most consumers trust review sites.
