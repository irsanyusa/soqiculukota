<time>23 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>“Bump” is full of characters who viewers become increasingly intimate with and, in turn, increasingly attached to – characters like Oly (Nathalie Morris), a bookish, fervent feminist and Santi (Carlos Sanson Jr.), a sensitive and artistically gifted stoner, who come together after an unexpected teen pregnancy. Oly’s family is Australian, whereas Santi’s comes from a Latin American background; cultural themes are explored, and there are many funny moments when their big, messy families come together.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The series has been praised for bringing Latin American culture to local and global screens. “Bump” lead actor Carlos Sanson Jr. was born in Sydney, and despite calling the land Down Under home, he is mixed Chilean and Cuban. Upon asking Carlos what it means to have Latin American culture portrayed on “Bump”, he responds, “It’s a huge honour, and it’s really special for me and my family to see me representing our culture.</span></p><p><span>“There’s not really another film or TV show that’s showcasing a South American family the way that ‘Bump’ does – being such central characters and so pivotal to the story. It’s been really nice to sort of own that culture within me because growing up in Australia I don’t think I really appreciated the value of it.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images-r2.thebrag.com/var/uploads/2023/12/Ep1.01_BUMP4_JOHN-PLATT_46750248-2.jpg><p><span>The show’s premise – captured in the opening scenes of the first episode – is a real-life urban myth. On a day that is set to be just like any other, Oly packs her bag, catches a ride to school with her mum, and, by recess, nearly gives birth in the toilet block of her inner-western Sydney high school as she is then rushed to hospital, completely unaware that she is pregnant and utterly bewildered by what is happening to her.</span></p><p><span>“Bump” invites audiences to witness an honest and accurate portrayal of what it’s like to become a parent at a young age. According to Nathalie, “Bump” was able to do this “by not judging it, but by kind of giving humour, respect and love to the experience.” She tells me that she’s been touched to receive positive feedback from young mums who watched the show and said to her that they felt “really seen and understood” by it. “Anytime I’ve had someone walk up to me on the street, they’re either a young mum or a couple who’ve just had a baby,” adds Carlos. “They love that ‘Bump’ gets the experience so right, and it makes me feel really proud, and like we’re doing the experience justice.”</span></p><p><span>The fourth season of the Australian comedy-drama takes a leap into the future, picking up two years after viewers were left wondering if Oly and Santi’s relationship would survive the many hurdles it had to overcome in Season 3. But, despite the mayhem that surrounds them, the storyline sees Oly and Santi reuniting, having finally stabilised their small family unit with their challenging and free-spirited seven-year-old Jacinda, played by Ava Cannon. Speaking of how Oly and Santi’s relationship has evolved in Season 4, Nathalie says, “They really lean into each other for support in all areas, and the intimacy is different. It’s the kind of intimacy where you really know someone so well that you can kind of manage their emotions and support them, which is lovely.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images-r2.thebrag.com/var/uploads/2023/12/Ep10.11_BUMP4_JOHN-PLATT_46890145-2.jpg><p><span>This season, Oly is the brand new breadwinner, while Santi struggles to adjust to his new life as a stay-at-home dad. Talking with Carlos, he explains that it’s been such a privilege to be able to break down traditional gender stereotypes in Season 4. “We’ve tried to create a really genuine portrayal of what being a stay-at-home dad looks like and challenging what a traditional household is supposed to look like. It was really interesting for me to stick my teeth into themes of what it is to be a man and a father. And I think it will be interesting for young men who watch it and maybe have their views challenged too.”</span></p><p><span>A new lens refocuses characters, with Oly’s mother, Angie (co-creator Claudia Karvan), having moved out of the Chalmers-Davis house into a protest camp, where she seeks to draw her attention away from her recent heartbreak through her environmental activism.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Dom (Angus Sampson) is happily re-living his share-house years with his best mate, Tim, while Reema (Safia Arain) and Vince (Ioane Sa’ula) begin to reckon with the fact that their relationship may not have a viable future. In a quest for self-discovery, Bowie (Christian Byers) is struggling through his Saturn return and big questions about his life’s direction.</span></p><p><span>Season four introduces a dynamic new cast, including the award-winning comedian Steph Tisdell and Dylan Alcott AO, the celebrated Australian tennis player and 2022 Australian of the Year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As the chaos of life ensues, the show continues with warm humour, a heartfelt exploration of the lives of the characters we have come to know and love. It takes no effort to return to the world of “Bump”, and we hope the show continues for many seasons to come.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The brand new season of the Stan Original Series “Bump” will premiere on Boxing Day. Every episode of Seasons 1, 2 and 3 is now streaming only on Stan.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=optional-screen-reader class=lrv-a-screen-reader-only>optional screen reader</h2><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpWPDor7InquyZpOkunB%2Bj2tqaKymZLOmrdOuqZ6rX5fCrryMrJyaq5%2BjenV5zZqroZmcnrJuuc6rqaKrXZius7jOrGSsmZ6ovK95yatkoqakmr%2B3tcSwZGpqYmiAcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbump-season-4-nathalie-morris-carlos-sanson-jr-interview-12233.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbump-season-4-nathalie-morris-carlos-sanson-jr-interview-12233.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbump-season-4-nathalie-morris-carlos-sanson-jr-interview-12233.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbump-season-4-nathalie-morris-carlos-sanson-jr-interview-12233.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbump-season-4-nathalie-morris-carlos-sanson-jr-interview-12233.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbump-season-4-nathalie-morris-carlos-sanson-jr-interview-12233.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dancehall.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dancehall.html>Dancehall in History - On This Day</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-mira-sorvino-the-veteran-actress-dancing-her-way-to-dwts-season-32.html>Who is Mira Sorvino?
