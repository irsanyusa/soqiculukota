Last year, a similar directive ostensibly with health and performance in mind was reportedly given by staff for Les Bleus, the team’s nickname, as a <a href=#>recommendation</a> but not a rule.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Already, in response to the fasting ban, youth midfielder Mahamadou Diawara has left the French men’s under-19 squad, <a href=#>ESPN</a> reported on Thursday. “Some players are not happy with this decision,” an agent who represents several players for the youth and senior French teams anonymously told ESPN. “Some don’t want to cause a fuss,” the agent added, but “they believe that their religion is not respected and that they are not respected either.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">FFF has not responded to TIME’s request for comment. But earlier this week, federation president Philippe Diallo defended the federation’s approach to Ramadan in an interview with French newspaper <a href=#>Le Figaro</a>, saying: “There is no stigmatization of anyone, there is absolute respect for everyone’s convictions. But when we are in the French team, we must respect a framework.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Diallo referred to Article 1 of <a href=#>the federation’s founding statute</a>, which he says ensures respect for the “principle of neutrality.” Under the article, “any speech or display of a political, ideological, religious or trade-union nature” is forbidden in competitions and events, with violators subject to “disciplinary and/or criminal proceedings.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fff-philippe-diallo.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The FFF has come under fire before for failing to accommodate Muslim players and even forcing them to violate their religious principles.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It was embroiled in controversy last year after an <a href=#>email leaked</a> in which referees for the country’s domestic professional league were ordered not to briefly pause matches at sunset during Ramadan so fasting players could hydrate and eat a snack pitchside. “A football field, a stadium, a gymnasium, are not places of political or religious expression, they are places of neutrality where values of sport, such as equality, fraternity, impartiality, learning to respect the referee, oneself, and others, must prevail,” the email <a href=#>reportedly</a> said, adding that there would be <a href=#>disciplinary consequences</a> for referees who did not comply. The FFF’s order stood in stark contrast to the French league’s counterparts around the world, including the <a href=#>English Premier League</a>, <a href=#>Germany’s Bundesliga</a>, and the <a href=#>Dutch Eredivisie</a>, where match officials have permitted such momentary pauses in play to accommodate Muslim players.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Amid backlash, during a <a href=#>game on April 2</a>, a Paris Saint-Germain fan group held up a sign that read: “A date, a glass of water, the nightmare of the FFF.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Also last year, the Council of State, France’s supreme court for administrative laws, <a href=#>upheld the FFF’s ban</a> on women players wearing hijabs, which had been appealed by a collective of Muslim players and human rights advocates who claimed that such a ban was discriminatory. The court, however, ruled that “sports federations, responsible for ensuring the proper functioning of the public service whose management is entrusted to them, can impose on their players an obligation of neutrality of outfits during competitions and sporting events in order to guarantee the smooth running of matches and prevent any confrontation.” It declared the FFF’s hijab ban, despite <a href=#>FIFA lifting a similar rule years earlier</a>, to be an “appropriate and proportionate” measure.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">France’s sports minister announced a similar prohibition on French athletes wearing headscarves during the upcoming Olympics, set to take place in Paris from July 26 to Aug. 11, <a href=#>drawing widespread condemnation</a>. A spokesperson for the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights <a href=#>slammed the ban</a>, saying: “Restrictions of expressions of religions or beliefs such as attire choices are only acceptable under really specific circumstances that address legitimate concerns for public safety, public order or public health or morals.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In response to news of the FFF’s recent Ramadan rule, the Everything Is Futbol podcast <a href=#>posted on X</a>: “Muslim players for France should sit out the national team until they reverse their decision.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“You’ll see how quickly France changes its ways once they realize they can’t field a good national team without multiple dual citizen French/African athletes,” the post added, referring to the fact that Les Bleus has <a href=#>historically been bolstered</a> by African and Arab migrants and children of migrants. “Muslim players have been and will continue to be a vital part of France’s success.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWVugnWBjp%2BpmqaTmnqnu86tmZqknGKzprDEq5itoZ%2BjerOtzJqbmqZdm660wMinnmaqpaGytHnMrqqloZ2oerS7wpycq2c%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrance-football-federation-ramadan-fasting-rules-muslims-soccer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffrance-football-federation-ramadan-fasting-rules-muslims-soccer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffrance-football-federation-ramadan-fasting-rules-muslims-soccer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffrance-football-federation-ramadan-fasting-rules-muslims-soccer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrance-football-federation-ramadan-fasting-rules-muslims-soccer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrance-football-federation-ramadan-fasting-rules-muslims-soccer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jill-lepore-interview-the-deadline.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jill-lepore-interview-the-deadline.html>Jill Lepore on Her New Book and Hating 'Barbie'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./transition-energetique-et-ecologique-decouvrez-les-cartes-interactives-des-prets-de-la-banque-des.html>dcouvrez les cartes interactives des prts de la Banque des Territoires</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./transition-energetique-et-ecologique-decouvrez-les-cartes-interactives-des-prets-de-la-banque-des.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
