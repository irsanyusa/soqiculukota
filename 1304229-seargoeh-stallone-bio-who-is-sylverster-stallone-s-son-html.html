While <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ventimiglia's facial deformity</a> was caused by dead nerves in his lower lip when he was born, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Stallone's was caused</a> by a medical intern during his birth.</p><p class=align-left>In an effort to speed up his birth, the practitioner pulled baby Sylvester from his mother's womb using forceps.
