<time>03 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>A&nbsp;mother-daughter relationship can sometimes be&nbsp;a&nbsp;plot for a&nbsp;real drama movie. Such thing happened to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Reddit user, who seemed to&nbsp;have demonstrated the warmest attitude to&nbsp;her daughter, who has kids and lives in&nbsp;her house. But the result of&nbsp;such a&nbsp;relationship turned into a&nbsp;huge family catastrophe, which may hurt many people, including the innocent kids. The desperate woman is&nbsp;now trying to&nbsp;resolve an&nbsp;uneasy dilemma.</p><p><h2>The mother-daughter relationship seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the warmest at&nbsp;first sight.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2bb/6ce/d390a258f8b568101660b1cbfc.jpg><p>A&nbsp;mother has turned to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Reddit</a> platform to&nbsp;ask for a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;advice regarding her very complicated situation with her own daughter. The woman, 45&nbsp;who goes by&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;Miserable-Day-8244, wrote that she has a&nbsp;daughter, 27, and six grandchildren. Her daughter and grandkids live with her, and the woman doesn’t even expect her daughter to&nbsp;pay any rent.</p><p>The woman added that all of&nbsp;her daughter’s kids have three different fathers, one of&nbsp;the dads is&nbsp;her current fiancé, who lives in&nbsp;the house together with her daughter and kids as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>The parents sheltered their daughter together with her big family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e0/436/a68d4253c388d3be2a45bd43ac.jpg><p>The woman continues her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>post</a>, saying that her daughter works part-time, and her husband-to-be works as&nbsp;a&nbsp;chef on&nbsp;a&nbsp;full time basis. The family have lived with the woman in&nbsp;her house for the past year and a&nbsp;half, all because they were evicted from their latest home. The kids and the daughter with her future husband use 2&nbsp;upstairs bedrooms in&nbsp;the house, and there’s still not so&nbsp;much space for their 6&nbsp;kids.</p><p>The couple are often asking the woman for help with phone bills, and the&nbsp;OP with her husband don’t ask them to&nbsp;pay for anything, because they want the young family to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;save money to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;home. But the woman confessed that saving for their own home was probably not something they were doing.</p><p><h2>The daughter left her mom in&nbsp;shock right on&nbsp;the Christmas Eve.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ea/ff4/4fbeec55ae9ac62f22729529e3.jpg><p>The woman goes on&nbsp;with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a>, saying that she has put up&nbsp;with loud voices throughout all hours, and waking up&nbsp;at&nbsp;different hours to&nbsp;cater to&nbsp;children. She explained that she really loves her grandchildren. She wrote that she never complained to&nbsp;her daughter because she thinks family is&nbsp;very important. She and her husband didn’t expect her daughter with her family to&nbsp;be&nbsp;living in&nbsp;their house this long. The woman wrote that they actually had some plans for remodeling their house, but they had put them away because of&nbsp;their daughter’s needs.</p><p>On&nbsp;Christmas Eve, the daughter gathered all family members all around and announced they were pregnant with baby #7. The woman revealed that everyone was all excited, but she just felt dread. She explained that this would mean another child in&nbsp;their house with not much room.</p><p>Her husband felt the same about the whole situation. They discussed later and decided they were going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;ask her daughter to&nbsp;move out with all her big family.</p><p><h2>The woman feels bad about her decision, but she feels this was the only one that would be&nbsp;right.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/742/3fd/7a24bf5692af46e6d3324e4c92.jpg><p>The woman then had to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bring it&nbsp;up</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;her daughter and her boyfriend and she told them, they have 2&nbsp;months to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;place because she and her husband couldn’t have another child there. Her daughter started crying, saying she couldn’t believe her own mom would throw her to&nbsp;the streets for having a&nbsp;baby. She claimed that this was completely unfair and not enough time. But the mother didn’t change her mind, she told her she was sorry. The woman confessed that this decision was painful for her as&nbsp;well, but the living conditions were just impossible.</p><p>Her daughter demanded she gave her more time, or&nbsp;she’d go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the courts and the woman told her news flash, the courts only give you 30&nbsp;days. She then said her grandchildren were going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;homeless because their grandma was selfish. The daughter even made a&nbsp;Facebook post asking for rooms to&nbsp;rent because “she’s pregnant and has nowhere to&nbsp;go, and her family don’t care about her.”</p><p><h2>People’s advice was controversial, yet many agreed with the woman.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f10/8ce/28be4e5d018f0877ef305e85dd.jpg><p>Responding to&nbsp;the woman’s post, many people felt for her. One person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “She is&nbsp;27, and it’s time for her to&nbsp;stand on&nbsp;her own two feet. I&nbsp;could not imagine having an&nbsp;extra nine people in&nbsp;my&nbsp;house, including an&nbsp;infant! They’ve been taking advantage for far too long, and should NEVER have added another pregnancy to&nbsp;the mix until they got their own place. Even then, it&nbsp;doesn’t sound like they can afford all these kids they keep having. This is&nbsp;not on&nbsp;you, they’ve made these life decisions &&nbsp;it’s time they figure it&nbsp;out.”</p><p>Another person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>, “The longer she stays, the more she is&nbsp;taking advantage of&nbsp;you and your husband. You know that. I&nbsp;don’t think you can just kick them out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;homeless (I’m thinking solely of&nbsp;your grandchildren here) but you can help them find subsidized or&nbsp;low income housing. Then they are on&nbsp;their own. The bank of&nbsp;mom &&nbsp;dad is&nbsp;closed. What they are doing to&nbsp;you is&nbsp;grossly unfair. Good luck.”</p><p>And here’s yet another <a href=#>complicated story</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman and her MIL, who called her a&nbsp;bad mother, and her husband didn’t stand for his wife.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZut8icop6cXaTCtXnMsmSpqpWcu6K602abmq2XncGmvoyapZ1lmJq%2FboKMpKCdq12stbB5y6KtnpxdrLa1tIymnGaqlaPBbrLRnpxmcGFsfnV9jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-kicked-out-my-pregnant-daughter-and-her-6-kids-who-lived-with-me-rent-free-817141.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fi-kicked-out-my-pregnant-daughter-and-her-6-kids-who-lived-with-me-rent-free-817141.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fi-kicked-out-my-pregnant-daughter-and-her-6-kids-who-lived-with-me-rent-free-817141.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fi-kicked-out-my-pregnant-daughter-and-her-6-kids-who-lived-with-me-rent-free-817141.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-kicked-out-my-pregnant-daughter-and-her-6-kids-who-lived-with-me-rent-free-817141.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-kicked-out-my-pregnant-daughter-and-her-6-kids-who-lived-with-me-rent-free-817141.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./verbos-modales-en-ingles.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./verbos-modales-en-ingles.html>Los verbos modales en ingls: Una gua bsica</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./britney-spears-book-celebrities.html>All the Celebrities in Britney Spears Memoir The Woman in Me</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./britney-spears-book-celebrities.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
