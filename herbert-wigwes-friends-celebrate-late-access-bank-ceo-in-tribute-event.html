He said the projects included Gateway International Airport and the Epe/Ijebu-Ode Road projects, among others.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He described Wigwe as a bridge builder, selfless, bold and courageous. He said it still felt like a bad dream that Herbert was gone, saying he was happy he honoured the invitation to see Wigwe’s new home.

He said that Wigwe’s commitment to reform and his genuine concern for the well-being of Nigerians garnered significant recognition.</p><p>The CBN Governor said he and the deceased recently discussed the way out of the country’s economic impasse, adding that the banker’s demise had left a vacuum in the bamling sector and the economy.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In his view, former CBN Governor, <strong>Lamido Sanusi</strong>, emphasised the immense value of Wigwe’s contributions and the challenges that could arise in finding a suitable replacement. Sanusi’s recognised Wigwe’s influence and the long-lasting imprint of his work, saying that further solidify the remarkable nature of his contributions.</p><p><strong>Ibrahim Dankwambo</strong>, former Senator for Gombe North and former of governor of Gombe State, said, “from Him we come, to Him we shall return” while reeling out good times with WigweCoopers Library.
